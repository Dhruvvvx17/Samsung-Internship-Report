Objective: Develop an end-to-end service to assist developers in the Voice Intelligence group at Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore, in tracking and analyzing application performance.

Key Features:
- Metric Forecasting: Predicts future values of application and system metrics using time series prediction models.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifies deviations from expected performance thresholds to prevent application degradation.
- Outlier Detection: Detects instances performing differently from others, ensuring consistent user experience.
- Alerts Module: Sends email alerts to users with predictions and relevant data.

Implementation Details:
- Developed Flask RESTful APIs and database operations using MongoDB and InfluxDB.
- Utilized Datadog for reliable metric data collection.
- Implemented cron jobs to automate data fetching, prediction generation, and alert sending.
- Compared various ML algorithms (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, LSTM-RNN) for the best forecasting model.
- Focused on minimizing dependencies on third-party applications, enhancing cost efficiency, and tailoring functionalities to specific team needs.

Learning Outcomes:
- Gained insights into project planning, industry decision-making, and effective communication.
- Learned about time series prediction, InfluxDB operations, and Linux utilities (Mutt and Cron).

This project showcases your ability to develop a comprehensive service that improves application performance monitoring, reduces costs, and enhances developer efficiency through tailored AI/ML solutions.
